        I value effective action, in myself and in others.
        <br/>
        Effective action is marked by clear desired results (goals) and work taken to obtain them.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        I have spent a good amount of time contemplating the way things are, I have figured out that things are the way they are. It is what is is.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are no rules, only rewards and consequences, this is the way things are.
        <br/>
        You are experiencing something, its significance is up for debate, this is the way things are.
        <br/>
        If you are spending more than 4 hours of your day on an application that optimizes for your attention and not your learning and growth, you will find it quite hard to achieve high levels of attainment.
