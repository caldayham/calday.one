                Hello, welcome to my public web ui. I am <a href="/home">Cal Day</a>, a 21 year old male from Canada
                and the USA. I enjoy effective problem finding and solving (aka solution derivation), solution simplification, and systematization -
                currently within the domains of manufacturing, software, business, finance, and health. I'm an optimist,
                especially towards radical self-growth. I also enjoy sharing time with family and friends, spirited debate and riffing, 
                and much more.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                My goal character traits:
                <br />
                interested, active, effective, prolific, antifragile, integrous, optimistic, autonomous, logical,
                radically volatile.
            </p>
